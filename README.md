# HTTP Handler for Automatic Redeployment on Qovery
This project is a good starting point to create an HTTP handler to redeploy your app on Qovery

This open-source template provides a generic starting point to create a simple HTTP handler in Go. It's designed to help you automatically redeploy your applications on Qovery when your content changes in your headless CMS.

## Use Case

This template is perfect for users with Server-Side Rendered (SSR) frontend apps that need to be rebuilt and redeployed when content changes. Examples of headless CMSs that could benefit from this template include Prismic, Strapi, Contentful, and more.

At Qovery, we use Prismic to manage our landing page content. Each time we update Prismic, we want to automatically redeploy our production and staging apps (depending on the tag). This template helps you set up the necessary HTTP handler for this purpose.
